# rl-project

# Installation

To install the framework we will need to create a new environment and install the dependences. To create the environment and to activate it:

```
conda create -n RL-project python=3.7.11
conda activate RL-project
```
Then we will need to install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, we have to install the environment:

```
cd gym-fuel
pip install -e .
```
